topic of big data competition 2024

To main approaches:
- LSTM based autoencoders to detect time series anomolies
- GCN (graph neural network) to detect network anomolies (a lot a money being transferred in small chunks for example) [Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) made simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KRAOZIULzw&t=311s)
